# Pronto

Pronto is an open-source ontology search engine. It provides fuzzy search capabilities across a number of popular ontologies, originally selected from the [prefix.cc](https://prefix.cc/) user-curated "popular" list, along with others picked by Wallscope. The results are ordered by relevance and can be inspected, which drastically reduces the time spent searching ontologies manually.

## Getting Started

Check out this [demo](https://pronto.wallscope.co.uk/) to see Pronto in action.

The instructions below will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See the deployment section for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

First of all, clone the repo with `git clone git@github.com:wallscope/pronto.git`

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- Yarn (or swap yarn commands with npm)
- Docker

## Development

To develop with Docker (recommended), run the command:

```
docker-compose up -d --build
```

To develop the individual parts of the stack, from different terminal instances run the commands `yarn install && yarn start` in the folders `frontend/` and `api/`. You will still need to run the database component separately.

## Deployment

### Docker

The quickest way to deploy Pronto is through Docker and its Compose tool.
From the root folder `pronto/` run:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose.prod.yaml up --build
```
